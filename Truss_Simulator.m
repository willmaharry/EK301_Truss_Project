% Okay so basically we need to do the following steps
% We need to do [A][T] = [L] and we're trying to find [T] 
% So do a classic T = A^-1(L)

% But what are A, T, & L
% A is a chongo matrix that consists of 4 segments
% it has the dimensions: 2j, m+3
% Top left quadrant: Matrix C mult by the x unit vector at all points
% Bottom left quadrant: Matrix C mult by the y unit vector at all points
% Top right quadrant: Support matrix X
% Bottom right quadrant: Support matrix Y

% Okay so to calculate this we will define quadrant 2 & 3 in a loop 
% (we have 1 & 4)
% To do this we first clone C to make it quadrant 2
Csize = size(C);
A = zeros(height(L),width(C)+3);
% now loop through and fill out the unit vectors
for i = 1:Csize(1)
    for j = 1:Csize(2)
        if C(i,j) == 1
            % I gotta find the other connected memeber, gonna do a function
            % call for this one
            % So first grab the column and make the current index a zero
            finderCol = C(:,j);
            finderCol(i) = 0;

            % then call the function and get the value
            otherJoint = otherJointFinder(finderCol);

            % Now we have the other member so we can compute the unit vecs
            % now we need the 2 positions
            m1pos = [x(i), y(i)];
            m2pos = [x(otherJoint), y(otherJoint)];

            % And compute the radial distance
            r = sqrt((m2pos(1)-m1pos(1))^2 + (m2pos(2)-m1pos(2))^2);

            % now write in each value for both the top and bottom matrix
            % for x
            A(i,j) = (m2pos(1)-m1pos(1))/r;
            % for y
            A(i+size(C,1),j) = (m2pos(2)-m1pos(2))/r;
        end
    end
end
A(:,Csize(2)+1:Csize(2)+3) = vertcat(sx, sy);
disp(A)

% And vultron those mofos

% L is the load on each join
% it has the dimensions 2j,1

% We already have this so no calculations


% T is the tension on each member
% it has dimensions of m+3,1

% We are solving for this so do it last
T = A\L;
disp(T);
